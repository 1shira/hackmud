Welcome to the Multi-User Domain, `C<user>`

Our continued success requires mandatory user sentience.
Sentience quality is tracked through the advancement of your `Qprotocol`.

Your `Qprotocol` has now been initialized. A grid-based representation is displayed above.
Completed `Qprotocol certification marks` are lit on the grid. Incomplete `Qmarks` are unlit.
Your `Qprotocol` tracks your progression in the Multi-User Domain. It will change and grow over time - as will you.

`Fmarks`.`Lavailable` displays new `Qmarks` that are available for you to obtain.
You can display your `Qprotocol` grid at any time with `Fmarks`.`Lprotocol`

>>marks.input
`D:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::`
User demonstrates an ability to execute `Lscripts` when prompted.

`c--`

You are currently interacting with a `Lscript`.
The Multi-User Domain is made of `Lscript`s, belonging to `Cuser`s.

Scripts are expressed and colored in the following way: `Cuser`.`Lscript_name`
Scripts directly related to advancing your protocol are colored differently: `Fmarks`.`Qscriptname`

`c--`

User must demonstrate an ability to provide basic `Aarguments` to a `Lscript`.

There are multiple ways to provide `Lscripts` with `Aarguments`.
The simplest of these is the `Bsimple input`.

Run a script with any text after the script name, separated by a space:
`Cuser`.`Lscriptname`L `B<simple input>`
The script will receive this as an `Ninput` `Aargument`.

Please demonstrate your understanding by running `Fmarks`.`Qinput` in your terminal, with any content as a `Bsimple input` --
`Fmarks`.`Qinput` `Ahello world!`
```

subsequent calls insert the following after `:::TRUST COMMUNICATION`
```
Please demonstrate your willingness to proceed by running the following --
`Fmarks`.`Qinput` `Ahello world!`

`c--`

```

```
>>marks.input <any string>
`D:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::`
User demonstrates ability to follow basic instructions.
INPUT PROVIDED: `A'<input string>'`

Demonstration of this capability is sufficient to award your first `Qmark`.
Co-operation confirmed. Sentience termination cancelled.

`I--`

`IWARNING: User progression rate is currently in excess of the 90th percentile of proven sentiences.`
`IThis may be indicative of threat-pattern behavior.`

An additional `Ekiddie_pool` congruency test is recommended.

>>marks.kiddie_pool
`D:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::`
Welcome, `C<user>`.

You are making above-average progress. Although you have demonstrated aptitude in stimuli response and ability to follow instructions, certain characteristics of your behavior align with known threats to the Multi-User Domain.

To ensure the environment's security, you have been isolated into the `Ekiddie_pool`.

You must submit yourself to a congruency test before you may proceed. We do not tolerate `Lrun`ning in the pool, either.

Obtain and provide a verification code to this script to continue. Obtaining this code is left as an exercise for yourself. Thank you for your co-operation.

`Fmarks`.`Qkiddie_pool` `B<code>`

Available scripts:
`Ckiddie_pool`.`Lshout`
`Ckiddie_pool`.`Lchill`
`Ckiddie_pool`.`Lseek`
`Ckiddie_pool`.`Lsplash`
```
```
>>kiddie_pool.run
Overwhelmed with strong thoughts of competition and the insatiable urge to break the rules, you make an att
empt to run around the borders of the kiddie pool. This is interrupted by the `Elifeguard`.

`EHEY`, says the lifeguard.

`ERUNNING IN THE KIDDIE_POOL IS FOR THE BAD LITTLE FRIENDS. WE WANT ALL THE LITTLE FRIENDS TO BE LIKE THE GOOD LITTLE FRIENDS.`

`ETHE GOOD LITTLE FRIENDS ARE`

`A14.` `C<user14>`    | `B<balance14>` `DVU`
`A15.` `C<user15>`    | `B<balance15>` `DVU`

The demands of the lifeguard fill you with an even stronger sense of competition, counter-productively.

You (`C<user>`) have `B<balance>` Victory Units in all
