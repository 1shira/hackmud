:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::
Welcome to the Multi-User Domain, da

Our continued success requires mandatory user sentience.
Sentience quality is tracked through the advancement of your protocol.

Your protocol has now been initialized. A grid-based representation is displayed above.
Completed protocol certification marks are lit on the grid. Incomplete marks are unlit.
Your protocol tracks your progression in the Multi-User Domain. It will change and grow over time - as will you.

marks.available displays new marks that are available for you to obtain.
You can display your protocol grid at any time with marks.protocol

:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::
User demonstrates an ability to execute scripts when prompted.

--

You are currently interacting with a script.
The Multi-User Domain is made of scripts, belonging to users.

Scripts are expressed and colored in the following way: user.script_name
Scripts directly related to advancing your protocol are colored differently: marks.scriptname

--

User must demonstrate an ability to provide basic arguments to a script.

There are multiple ways to provide scripts with arguments.
The simplest of these is the simple input.

Run a script with any text after the script name, separated by a space:
user.scriptname <simple input>
The script will receive this as an input argument.

Please demonstrate your understanding by running marks.input in your terminal, with any content as a simple input --
marks.input hello world!
```
subsequent calls insert the following after `:::TRUST COMMUNICATION`
```
Please demonstrate your willingness to proceed by running the following --
marks.input hello world!

--
```

```
>>marks.input <any string>
:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::
User demonstrates ability to follow basic instructions.
INPUT PROVIDED: '<input string>'

Demonstration of this capability is sufficient to award your first mark.
Co-operation confirmed. Sentience termination cancelled.

--

WARNING: User progression rate is currently in excess of the 90th percentile of proven sentiences.
This may be indicative of threat-pattern behavior.

An additional kiddie_pool congruency test is recommended.

:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::
Proceed to marks.kiddie_pool

>>marks.kiddie_pool
:::TRUST COMMUNICATION:::
Welcome, <user>.

You are making above-average progress. Although you have demonstrated aptitude in stimuli response and ability to follow instructions, certain characteristics of your behavior align with known threats to the Multi-User Domain.

To ensure the environment's security, you have been isolated into the kiddie_pool.

You must submit yourself to a congruency test before you may proceed. We do not tolerate running in the pool, either.

Obtain and provide a verification code to this script to continue. Obtaining this code is left as an exercise for yourself. Thank you for your co-operation.

marks.kiddie_pool <code>

Available scripts:
kiddie_pool.shout
kiddie_pool.chill
kiddie_pool.seek
kiddie_pool.splash

>>kiddie_pool.run
Overwhelmed with strong thoughts of competition and the insatiable urge to break the rules, you make an att
empt to run around the borders of the kiddie pool. This is interrupted by the lifeguard.

HEY, says the lifeguard.

RUNNING IN THE KIDDIE_POOL IS FOR THE BAD LITTLE FRIENDS. WE WANT ALL THE LITTLE FRIENDS TO BE LIKE THE GOO
D LITTLE FRIENDS.

THE GOOD LITTLE FRIENDS ARE

1.  <user1>     | <balance1> VU
2.  <user2>     | <balance2> VU
3.  <user3>     | <balance3> VU
4.  <user4>     | <balance4> VU
5.  <user5>     | <balance5> VU
6.  <user6>     | <balance6> VU
7.  <user7>     | <balance7> VU
8.  <user8>     | <balance8> VU
9.  <user9>     | <balance9> VU
10. <user10>    | <balance10> VU
11. <user11>    | <balance11> VU
12. <user12>    | <balance12> VU
13. <user13>    | <balance13> VU
14. <user14>    | <balance14> VU
15. <user15>    | <balance15> VU

The demands of the lifeguard fill you with an even stronger sense of competition, counter-productively.

You (<user>) have <balance> Victory Units in all
